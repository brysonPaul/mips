# mips
Hi there! This is a project that I worked on for my CDA3103C class this semester at UCF. Basically what this does is that it simulates how a CPU would read assembly instructions,
complete with proper stores and loads of memory and registers. Because this was given in class, I wrote the inner parts of all the methods in project.c, but the method header, spimcore.c, and all other
files were given to us by the professor.
